# Guide to Installing Roothide-Dopamine2 Using TrollStore

This guide will walk you through the process of installing TrollStore using Sideloadly, and then using TrollStore to install Roothide-Dopamine2 on your iOS device. **Dopamine2** is a rootless semi-untethered jailbreak compatible with iOS 15.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e) and iOS 15.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64).

## Prerequisites

1. **Ensure you have the following:**
   - **[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/#download)**: For sideloading apps.
   - **The latest version of iTunes** (if using Windows).
   - **[TrollInstallerX](https://github.com/alfiecg24/TrollInstallerX/releases/tag/1.0.2)**: For initial setup or [TrollStore](https://trollstore.app/) installation.
   - **[Dopamine2-Roothide](https://github.com/akewcrafts/Dopamine2-roothide/releases/tag/2.1.7)**: Download the latest `.tipa` file.

## Installing TrollStore Using Sideloadly

1. **Open Sideloadly** on your computer.
2. **Connect your iOS device** to your computer via USB.
3. Ensure your computer is **trusted** and can view your device's contents.
4. **Drag and drop** the **TrollStore `.ipa`** file into Sideloadly.
5. **Enter your Apple ID** and **password**.

   > Sideloadly requires server connection for free developer accounts. If you prefer, use an alternate Apple ID.

6. **The TrollStore app will install** onto your iOS device.

   > **Note:** **TrollInstallerX** can also be signed at [jailbreaks.app](https://jailbreaks.app) for installation without a computer.

## Trusting TrollStore

1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **General** -> **Device Management** -> `<Your Apple ID>`.
   - This might be labeled as **Profiles & Device Management** depending on your iOS version.
2. Tap **Trust "<Your Apple ID>"**.
3. **Open the TrollStore application** from your home screen.

## Installing Dopamine2-Roothide from TrollStore

1. **Launch TrollStore** on your device.
2. **Go to the Apps tab** if you aren't there already.
3. Tap the **+** icon located at the top right corner.
4. Locate and tap the **Dopamine2-Roothide `.tipa`** file you downloaded.

## Running Dopamine2-Roothide

1. **Open the Dopamine2** app from your home screen.

   - If the app or device crashes/restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't applied, reboot and try the exploit again until it works.

   > **Note:** Issues with touchscreen functionality after rebooting into a jailbroken state are often due to low-quality replacement screens. This problem is not related to Dopamine2 and requires a better screen replacement.

3. **Sileo** should now be available on your home screen. Use Sileo to install tweaks, themes, and more.
